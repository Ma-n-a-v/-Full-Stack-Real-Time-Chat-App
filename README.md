# Full-Stack-Real-Time-Chat-App
Welcome to my Full-Stack Real-Time Chat Application project! 🚀 In this project, I built a real-time chat application where users can sign up, log in, send messages (including images), view conversations, and interact with online users. This project showcases the power of modern web technologies for both front-end and back-end development. The application is responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. 📱💻

## Project Overview: 📚
This project is divided into two main parts:

### Frontend Development: 
Using React, I implemented the sign-up/login system, homepage, profile page, settings page with theme selection, and the ability to send/receive messages in real-time. The front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI, ensuring a responsive, user-friendly design. 🎨

### Backend Development: 
On the server side, Node.js with Express handles API requests, user authentication, and real-time communication with Socket.IO. The backend uses MongoDB for data storage, and JWT ensures secure authentication. 🔒
